# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender (Content-Based, Streamlit)

This interactive app suggests movies that are most similar to the one you choose. It analyzes each filmâ€™s genre, cast, director, and short summary to find the closest matches and shows their posters instantly.
The app uses content-based filtering, meaning it focuses on movie attributes instead of user ratings or watch history.
Built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, this demo runs inside a **Docker** container and uses the TMDB to display movie posters.

## âœ¨ What it does

- Pick a movie from the dropdown
- Computes similarity to all other movies
- Shows **five most similar** titles + posters (via TMDB)

## ðŸ§  How it works (high level)

1. **Text features** are assembled into a `tags` field (genres + top cast + director + processed overview).
2. `CountVectorizer` converts `tags` into vectors (bag-of-words).
3. **Cosine similarity** measures how close movies are in that vector space.
4. For the selected movie, the app returns the **nearest neighbors**.

> Cosine similarity compares **angles**, so two descriptions with the same mix of terms match even if one is longer.
